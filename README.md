# LockdownDay (#ConfinementJour) COVID-19-TweetIDs

For the associated research paper see https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2005/2005.05075.pdf


This repository contains an ongoing collection of tweets IDs associated with the lockdown period due to the coronavirus COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), that started in France on March 17, 2020. 

We used the Twitter‚Äôs search API to gather on a daily basis Tweets defined by  hashtags #confinementJour1 to #confinementJour_n (that is LockdownDay1 to n).

To comply with Twitter‚Äôs [Terms of Service](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy), we are only publicly releasing the Tweet IDs of the collected Tweets. The data is released for non-commercial research use. 

Additionally we release annotations of this corpus using sentiment and emotions mesurement instruments. This allows researchers to evaluate the capability of these tools to capture variations of √©motions expressed by people on a daily basis.

## Data Organization
### Tweet Sentiment and Emotion Annotations Files
Sentiment and Emotion Annotations files (in .csv format) are available in the LockdownAnnot folder. Their names have the following pattern dff_method_numberOfDays_chunk.csv (dff meaning data frame free and the method is nrc,lsd or emoji). 


#### dff\_nrc\_55\_1.csv
Nrc files contain ten columns: the first eight represent emotions frequencies and the last two sentiments frequencies per tweet

| anger | anticipation | disgust | fear | joy | sadness | surprise | trust | negative | positive |
| ----: | -----------: | ------: | ---: | --: | ------: | -------: | ----: | -------: | -------: |
|     0 |            0 |       0 |    0 |   0 |       0 |        0 |     0 |        0 |        0 |
|     0 |            0 |       0 |    1 |   0 |       0 |        1 |     0 |        3 |        0 |
|     1 |            1 |       0 |    2 |   1 |       1 |        1 |     4 |        2 |        2 |
|     0 |            1 |       0 |    2 |   0 |       1 |        0 |     0 |        1 |        0 |

#### dff\_lsd\_55\_1.csv
Lsd files contain four columns negative and positive sentiment frequency, number of words and identification number of the tweets
    
| Neg\_lsdfr | Pos\_lsdfr | nb | id |
| ---------: | ---------: | -: | -: |
|          0 |          0 |  1 |  1 |
|          0 |          0 | 20 |  2 |
|          0 |          1 | 38 |  3 |
|          1 |          1 | 26 |  4 |


#### dff\_emos\_55\_1.csv
Emoji files contain five columns. The first is a list of emojis separated by ";", the second indicates the number of emojis per tweet. The other three indicate the minimum, average and maximum sentiment score (on a scale from -1 to 1) 


| emoji  | nemoji | min\_sentsc | mean\_sentsc | max\_sentsc |
| :----- | -----: | ----------: | -----------: | ----------: |
| ;      |      0 |          NA |           NA |          NA |
| üòÇ;üòÇ;üòÇ; |      3 |       0.221 |       0.2210 |       0.221 |
| üì∑;     |      1 |       0.430 |       0.4300 |       0.430 |
| üòÜ;üòÖ;ü§£; |      3 |       0.178 |       0.2935 |       0.409 |

### Tweet IDs files

The Tweet-IDs that help recover (hydrate) all collected datasets are organized as follows:
* Tweet-ID files are stored in two folders LockdownDays and LockdownOther. The first has tweets collected with the lockdown day hashtag #ConfinementJourX, the second one contains tweets collected using a larger set of hashtags indicating the lockdown period.
* The file names have the following pattern: a prefix ‚Äúdf_ids‚Äù followed by either "jX" indicating the day (jour) for the first folder and by "confX" meaning lockdown (confinement) for the second.

## Notes About the Data
A few notes about this data: 
* We have been maintaining this database during the 55 Lockdown day mentioned above.  
* Consider using tools such as the [Hydrator](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator) and [Twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) to rehydrate the Tweet IDs. Instructions for both are in the next section. 
* Hydrating may take a while, and Tweets may have been deleted since our initial collection. If that is the case, unfortunately you will not be able to get the deleted Tweets from querying Twitter's API.

## How to Hydrate

### Hydrating using [Hydrator](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator) (GUI)
Navigate to the [Hydrator github repository](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator) and follow the instructions for installation in their README. As there are a lot of separate Tweet ID files in this repository, it might be advisable to first merge files from timeframes of interest into a larger file before hydrating the Tweets through the GUI. 

### Hydrating using [Twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) (CLI)
Many thanks to Ed Summers ([edsu](https://github.com/edsu)) for writing this script that uses [Twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) to hydrate all Tweet-IDs stored (in their corresponding folders). 

First install Twarc and tqdm
```
pip3 install twarc
pip3 install tqdm
```

Configure Twarc with your Twitter API tokens (note you must [apply](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access) for a Twitter developer account first in order to obtain the needed tokens). You can also configure the API tokens in the script, if unable to configure through CLI. 
```
twarc configure
```

Run the script. The hydrated Tweets will be stored in the same folder as the Tweet-ID file, and is saved as a compressed jsonl file
```
python3 hydrate.py
```
